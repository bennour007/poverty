# poverty

In this repo I extract the data from the INS report and organise it into csv files. 

I extracted the poverty data for each county, these can be found in the files t1 to t24.

In addition, I also extracted the state wise rates in file t26, and the county wise table at the end of the docuemnt in file t25.

I will inlude all of this in a article in my blog and share real soon.

Thank you @Iyed for telling me about this.

Cheers everyone.
